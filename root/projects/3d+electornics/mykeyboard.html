<h1>Why this project was started</h1>
This project started with the idea of changing the main way I interact with the computer. Are there any other ways a keyboard can be made? I thought, and this led to research on different types of keyboard layouts. I learnt that there was a group of hobbyists who made different types of keyboard, namely, ortholinears, which columns were not staggered. There was also a type of split keyboard, which spilt the whole keyboard into 2, one for each hand. I also learnt of the software they used to use the keyboard, QMK, and most used a arduino promicro to make it. I also learnt of the keyboard matrix, allowing for a much greater number of buttons than IO ports on the microcontroller.<br>
<h1>Progress</h1>
Knowing nothing about design, soldering or prototyping, I bought the keys, watched tutorials to design the case, and below is the prototype:<br>

<br>There was a problem where the port kept breaking off. After much redesigning and reprinting almost the whole keyboard, the final version is below:<br>

I am rather pleased with the outcome: no more breaking of micro usb port. I have also gotten used to using different layers to code, and now typing and coding have become easier and faster. This also allowed me to learn how to solder and how to use the QMK library. I have also learned how to design parts needing minimal supports.<br>
