Sound Voltex is a series of Japanese arcade rhythm games which inputs consists of 6 keys and 2 rotary encoders. I have recently gotten into this game as I have been playing rhythm games for a while. As it is an arcade game, It is rather expensive, and therefore I decided to build this controllers with some spare parts.<br>
This is the first attempt at printing multicolour.<br>
Turned out rather well I believe<br>
The end product is below:<br>
