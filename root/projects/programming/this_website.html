<h1>Personal Website</h1>
after scouring the internet for designs, i have finally decided to be inspired by the linux terminal which i almost use daily as the theme for the website. it was interesting to make a simple command system with a little autocomplete generally a fun project overall. what was not fun was needing to add the information, which i now have to force myself to do it.
<br>overall: ok/10
