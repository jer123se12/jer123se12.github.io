<h1>Onshape (CAD software)</h1>
After getting the basics down in tinkercad, this is my first professional 3D CAD software that I learnt, by myself. This helped me to make all my 3d design projects that I have created thus far. Some of the designs include my personal keyboard, Sound Voltex Controller, and other miscellaneous objects.
