This is another adventure in creating a game with Javascript. I find that this is interesting as this only uses divs as the blocks and not a canvas. this allows for easy switching of the themes for the blocks.
This also allowed me to learn alot of how to manipulate a 2d matrix. Very fun adventure. I rate it a fun/10
