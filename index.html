      Dearest creature in creation<br>
      Studying English pronunciation,<br>
         I will teach you in my verse<br>
         Sounds like corpse, corps, horse and worse.<br>
         <br>
      I will keep you, Susy, busy,<br>
      Make your head with heat grow dizzy;<br>
         Tear in eye, your dress you'll tear;<br>
         Queer, fair seer, hear my prayer.<br>
         <br>
      Pray, console your loving poet,<br>
      Make my coat look new, dear, sew it!<br>
         Just compare heart, hear and heard,<br>
         Dies and diet, lord and word.<br>
      
      Sword and sward, retain and Britain<br>
      (Mind the latter how it's written).<br>
         Made has not the sound of bade,<br>
         Say-said, pay-paid, laid but plaid.<br>
         <br>
      Now I surely will not plague you<br>
      With such words as vague and ague,<br>
         But be careful how you speak,<br>
         Say: gush, bush, steak, streak, break, bleak ,<br>
      <br>
      Previous, precious, fuchsia, via<br>
      Recipe, pipe, studding-sail, choir;<br>
         Woven, oven, how and low,<br>
         Script, receipt, shoe, poem, toe.<br>
      <br>
      Say, expecting fraud and trickery:<br>
      Daughter, laughter and Terpsichore,<br>
         Branch, ranch, measles, topsails, aisles,<br>
         Missiles, similes, reviles.<br>
      <br>
      Wholly, holly, signal, signing,<br>
      Same, examining, but mining,<br>
         Scholar, vicar, and cigar,<br>
         Solar, mica, war and far.<br>
      <br>
      From "desire": desirable-admirable from "admire",<br>
      Lumber, plumber, bier, but brier,<br>
         Topsham, brougham, renown, but known,<br>
         Knowledge, done, lone, gone, none, tone,<br>
      <br>
      One, anemone, Balmoral,<br>
      Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel.<br>
         Gertrude, German, wind and wind,<br>
         Beau, kind, kindred, queue, mankind,<br>
      <br>
      Tortoise, turquoise, chamois-leather,<br>
      Reading, Reading, heathen, heather.<br>
         This phonetic labyrinth<br>
         Gives moss, gross, brook, brooch, ninth, plinth.<br>
      <br>
      Have you ever yet endeavoured<br>
      To pronounce revered and severed,<br>
         Demon, lemon, ghoul, foul, soul,<br>
         Peter, petrol and patrol?<br>
      <br>
      Billet does not end like ballet;<br>
      Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.<br>
         Blood and flood are not like food,<br>
         Nor is mould like should and would.<br>
      <br>
      Banquet is not nearly parquet,<br>
      Which exactly rhymes with khaki.<br>
         Discount, viscount, load and broad,<br>
         Toward, to forward, to reward,<br>
      <br>
      Ricocheted and crocheting, croquet?<br>
      Right! Your pronunciation's OK.<br>
         Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,<br>
         Friend and fiend, alive and live.<br>
      <br>
      Is your r correct in higher?<br>
      Keats asserts it rhymes Thalia.<br>
         Hugh, but hug, and hood, but hoot,<br>
         Buoyant, minute, but minute.<br>
      <br>
      Say abscission with precision,<br>
      Now: position and transition;<br>
         Would it tally with my rhyme<br>
         If I mentioned paradigm?<br>
      <br>
      Twopence, threepence, tease are easy,<br>
      But cease, crease, grease and greasy?<br>
         Cornice, nice, valise, revise,<br>
         Rabies, but lullabies.<br>
      <br>
      Of such puzzling words as nauseous,<br>
      Rhyming well with cautious, tortious,<br>
         You'll envelop lists, I hope,<br>
         In a linen envelope.<br>
      <br>
      Would you like some more? You'll have it!<br>
      Affidavit, David, davit.<br>
         To abjure, to perjure. Sheik<br>
         Does not sound like Czech but ache.<br>
      <br>
      Liberty, library, heave and heaven,<br>
      Rachel, loch, moustache, eleven.<br>
         We say hallowed, but allowed,<br>
         People, leopard, towed but vowed.<br>
      <br>
      Mark the difference, moreover,<br>
      Between mover, plover, Dover.<br>
         Leeches, breeches, wise, precise,<br>
         Chalice, but police and lice,<br>
      <br>
      Camel, constable, unstable,<br>
      Principle, disciple, label.<br>
         Petal, penal, and canal,<br>
         Wait, surmise, plait, promise, pal,<br>
      <br>
      Suit, suite, ruin. Circuit, conduit<br>
      Rhyme with "shirk it" and "beyond it",<br>
         But it is not hard to tell<br>
         Why it's pall, mall, but Pall Mall.<br>
      <br>
      Muscle, muscular, gaol, iron,<br>
      Timber, climber, bullion, lion,<br>
         Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair,<br>
         Senator, spectator, mayor,<br>
      <br>
      Ivy, privy, famous; clamour<br>
      Has the a of drachm and hammer.<br>
         Pussy, hussy and possess,<br>
         Desert, but desert, address.<br>
      <br>
      Golf, wolf, countenance, lieutenants<br>
      Hoist in lieu of flags left pennants.<br>
         Courier, courtier, tomb, bomb, comb,<br>
         Cow, but Cowper, some and home.<br>
      <br>
      "Solder, soldier! Blood is thicker",<br>
      Quoth he, "than liqueur or liquor",<br>
         Making, it is sad but true,<br>
         In bravado, much ado.<br>
      <br>
      Stranger does not rhyme with anger,<br>
      Neither does devour with clangour.<br>
         Pilot, pivot, gaunt, but aunt,<br>
         Font, front, wont, want, grand and grant.<br>
      <br>
      Arsenic, specific, scenic,<br>
      Relic, rhetoric, hygienic.<br>
         Gooseberry, goose, and close, but close,<br>
         Paradise, rise, rose, and dose.<br>
      <br>
      Say inveigh, neigh, but inveigle,<br>
      Make the latter rhyme with eagle.<br>
         Mind! Meandering but mean,<br>
         Valentine and magazine.<br>
      <br>
      And I bet you, dear, a penny,<br>
      You say mani-(fold) like many,<br>
         Which is wrong. Say rapier, pier,<br>
         Tier (one who ties), but tier.<br>
      <br>
      Arch, archangel; pray, does erring<br>
      Rhyme with herring or with stirring?<br>
         Prison, bison, treasure trove,<br>
         Treason, hover, cover, cove,<br>
      <br>
      Perseverance, severance. Ribald<br>
      Rhymes (but piebald doesn't) with nibbled.<br>
         Phaeton, paean, gnat, ghat, gnaw,<br>
         Lien, psychic, shone, bone, pshaw.<br>
      <br>
      Don't be down, my own, but rough it,<br>
      And distinguish buffet, buffet;<br>
         Brood, stood, roof, rook, school, wool, boon,<br>
         Worcester, Boleyn, to impugn.<br>
      <br>
      Say in sounds correct and sterling<br>
      Hearse, hear, hearken, year and yearling.<br>
         Evil, devil, mezzotint,<br>
         Mind the z! (A gentle hint.)<br>
      <br>
      Now you need not pay attention<br>
      To such sounds as I don't mention,<br>
         Sounds like pores, pause, pours and paws,<br>
         Rhyming with the pronoun yours;<br>
      <br>
      Nor are proper names included,<br>
      Though I often heard, as you did,<br>
         Funny rhymes to unicorn,<br>
         Yes, you know them, Vaughan and Strachan.<br>
      <br>
      No, my maiden, coy and comely,<br>
      I don't want to speak of Cholmondeley.<br>
         No. Yet Froude compared with proud<br>
         Is no better than McLeod.<br>
      <br>
      But mind trivial and vial,<br>
      Tripod, menial, denial,<br>
         Troll and trolley, realm and ream,<br>
         Schedule, mischief, schism, and scheme.<br>
      <br>
      Argil, gill, Argyll, gill. Surely<br>
      May be made to rhyme with Raleigh,<br>
         But you're not supposed to say<br>
         Piquet rhymes with sobriquet.<br>
      <br>
      Had this invalid invalid<br>
      Worthless documents? How pallid,<br>
         How uncouth he, couchant, looked,<br>
         When for Portsmouth I had booked!<br>
      <br>
      Zeus, Thebes, Thales, Aphrodite,<br>
      Paramour, enamoured, flighty,<br>
         Episodes, antipodes,<br>
         Acquiesce, and obsequies.<br>
      <br>
      Please don't monkey with the geyser,<br>
      Don't peel 'taters with my razor,<br>
         Rather say in accents pure:<br>
         Nature, stature and mature.<br>
      <br>
      Pious, impious, limb, climb, glumly,<br>
      Worsted, worsted, crumbly, dumbly,<br>
         Conquer, conquest, vase, phase, fan,<br>
         Wan, sedan and artisan.<br>
      <br>
      The th will surely trouble you<br>
      More than r, ch or w.<br>
         Say then these phonetic gems:<br>
         Thomas, thyme, Theresa, Thames.<br>
      <br>
      Thompson, Chatham, Waltham, Streatham,<br>
      There are more but I forget 'em-<br>
         Wait! I've got it: Anthony,<br>
         Lighten your anxiety.<br>
      <br>
      The archaic word albeit<br>
      Does not rhyme with eight-you see it;<br>
         With and forthwith, one has voice,<br>
         One has not, you make your choice.<br>
      <br>
      Shoes, goes, does *. Now first say: finger;<br>
      Then say: singer, ginger, linger.<br>
         Real, zeal, mauve, gauze and gauge,<br>
         Marriage, foliage, mirage, age,<br>
      <br>
      Hero, heron, query, very,<br>
      Parry, tarry fury, bury,<br>
         Dost, lost, post, and doth, cloth, loth,<br>
         Job, Job, blossom, bosom, oath.<br>
      <br>
      Faugh, oppugnant, keen oppugners,<br>
      Bowing, bowing, banjo-tuners<br>
         Holm you know, but noes, canoes,<br>
         Puisne, truism, use, to use?<br>
      <br>
      Though the difference seems little,<br>
      We say actual, but victual,<br>
         Seat, sweat, chaste, caste, Leigh, eight, height,<br>
         Put, nut, granite, and unite.<br>
      <br>
      Reefer does not rhyme with deafer,<br>
      Feoffer does, and zephyr, heifer.<br>
         Dull, bull, Geoffrey, George, ate, late,<br>
         Hint, pint, senate, but sedate.<br>
      <br>
      Gaelic, Arabic, pacific,<br>
      Science, conscience, scientific;<br>
         Tour, but our, dour, succour, four,<br>
         Gas, alas, and Arkansas.<br>
      <br>
      Say manoeuvre, yacht and vomit,<br>
      Next omit, which differs from it<br>
         Bona fide, alibi<br>
         Gyrate, dowry and awry.<br>
      <br>
      Sea, idea, guinea, area,<br>
      Psalm, Maria, but malaria.<br>
         Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean,<br>
         Doctrine, turpentine, marine.<br>
      <br>
      Compare alien with Italian,<br>
      Dandelion with battalion,<br>
         Rally with ally; yea, ye,<br>
         Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, key, quay!<br>
      <br>
      Say aver, but ever, fever,<br>
      Neither, leisure, skein, receiver.<br>
         Never guess-it is not safe,<br>
         We say calves, valves, half, but Ralf.<br>
      <br>
      Starry, granary, canary,<br>
      Crevice, but device, and eyrie,<br>
         Face, but preface, then grimace,<br>
         Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass.<br>
      <br>
      Bass, large, target, gin, give, verging,<br>
      Ought, oust, joust, and scour, but scourging;<br>
         Ear, but earn; and ere and tear<br>
         Do not rhyme with here but heir.<br>
      <br>
      Mind the o of off and often<br>
      Which may be pronounced as orphan,<br>
         With the sound of saw and sauce;<br>
         Also soft, lost, cloth and cross.<br>
      <br>
      Pudding, puddle, putting. Putting?<br>
      Yes: at golf it rhymes with shutting.<br>
         Respite, spite, consent, resent.<br>
         Liable, but Parliament.<br>
      <br>
      Seven is right, but so is even,<br>
      Hyphen, roughen, nephew, Stephen,<br>
         Monkey, donkey, clerk and jerk,<br>
         Asp, grasp, wasp, demesne, cork, work.<br>
      <br>
      A of valour, vapid vapour,<br>
      S of news (compare newspaper),<br>
         G of gibbet, gibbon, gist,<br>
         I of antichrist and grist,<br>
      <br>
      Differ like diverse and divers,<br>
      Rivers, strivers, shivers, fivers.<br>
         Once, but nonce, toll, doll, but roll,<br>
         Polish, Polish, poll and poll.<br>
      <br>
      Pronunciation-think of Psyche!-<br>
      Is a paling, stout and spiky.<br>
         Won't it make you lose your wits<br>
         Writing groats and saying "grits"?<br>
      <br>
      It's a dark abyss or tunnel<br>
      Strewn with stones like rowlock, gunwale,<br>
         Islington, and Isle of Wight,<br>
         Housewife, verdict and indict.<br>
      <br>
      Don't you think so, reader, rather,<br>
      Saying lather, bather, father?<br>
         Finally, which rhymes with enough,<br>
         Though, through, bough, cough, hough, sough, tough??<br>
         <br>
         Hiccough has the sound of sup...<br>
      My advice is: GIVE IT UP!<br>
