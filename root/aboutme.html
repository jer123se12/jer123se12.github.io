I'm Jerick!<br>
<br>
Hi! I am Jerick Seng, currently <div class="age" style="display:inline" >(smt wrong i need fixxxxxxx)</div> years old.<br>
I have loved to tinker with things since young, which led me to make many different things, like apps with swift, scripts with python, websites with HTML, and embedded systems with C++. I have also picked up Onshape, a Computer Aided Design (CAD) software, and used a 3d printer to design and build my own personal keyboard. Through it I also learned some basic electronics and soldering.<br><br>

I studied in Maris Stella High School (Primary). During my time there, I participated in the Badminton CCA from primary 1-6 and Robotics from primary 3-5. In Badminton, I made it into the school team. In Robotics, I participated in the National Robotics Competition(NRC), then called the National Junior Robotics Competition(NJRC), in primary 5. <br><br>

I managed to pass the DSA for the School of Science and Technology, Singapore and thus am studying there for my secondary school. In secondary one, I had to choose between Badminton and robotics, and after some consideration, I chose Robotics, and I did not regret my decision. I also joined one of our schools' talent development programs — SST Inc, A talent development program for app development that helps the society. SST Inc. introduced me to people of similar interests, and this further fueled my passion in both programming and electronics. I managed to pass the aptitude test for the Swift Accelerator Programme, and thus, I enrolled in it. It allowed me to learn more in depth app development and I even managed to publish an app onto the app store! I also picked up the App Development with Swift Level 1 certificate through the course.In secondary 3, I joined computing, and studied python programming.<br><br>
