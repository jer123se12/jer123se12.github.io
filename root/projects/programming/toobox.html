<h1>Toobox (School Coursework)</h1><br>
This is a project for our Computing  + Coursework. I worked on this project with 2 other friends, Ethan Chew and Granwyn Tan. I was mainly in charge of the algorithms that run in the background. But in the end, all 3 of us touched on all parts of the code.<br>
