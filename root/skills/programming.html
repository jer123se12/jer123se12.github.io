<h1>Javascript + HTML + CSS</h1>
I found Javascript, HTML and CSS to be interesting as It allowed me to make small little websites that anyone can use anywhere with just a web browser. Some of the things that I have created are a Tetris game, My personal website, and a homepage.<br>
<h1>Python</h1>
I started to learn python in primary 5, being introduced to it through youtube videos. This is my most experienced language, and I have made many things with it, I made a rhythm game, another Tetris clone and scripts that I found along the way.<br>
<h1>C++</h1>
I started to learn C++ in around secondary 1, as I was learning arduino programming around that time. Being interested in its speed, I dived deeper into it, doing some small projects in my spare time with it. Notable things include a image to ascii converter, the game 2048<br>
